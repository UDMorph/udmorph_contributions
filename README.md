# UDMorph Contibutions

This is a dedicated project where people can contribute to UDMorph

- Create a fork of the corpus, add any new taggers or data-sets there and provide a merge request. Forked branches will by deafult be used in private new branches.
- Create an issue to provide any feedback. Feedback can be to provide a contact to new data, a request to set-up a new TEITOK corpus for a new language, a link to a repository with a full-data that can be mirrored on UDMorph, etc. 

## Contribution types

Contributions can be of various type, including:

- Existing UD-conformant annotated data-sets that can be hosted as a repository in this organisation
- Requests for a new project in the TEITOK environment, which helps to create a gold-standard annotated corpus
- An existing data-set that can be converted to UD, and maintained either as a repository or in the TEITOK GUI
- A link to a REST service for a tagger, ideally with an output in CoNLL-U
- A model for a tagger/lemmatizer for UDPIPE, Stanza, or Spacy, ideally following UD annotations
- The source code for a tagger that can be installed locally, ideally with an output in CoNLL-U
