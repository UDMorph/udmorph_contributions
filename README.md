# UDMorph Contibutions

This is a dedicated project where people can contribute to UDMorph

- Create a fork of the corpus, add any new taggers or data-sets there and provide a merge request. Forked branches will by deafult be used in private new branches.
- Create an issue to provide any feedback. Feedback can be to provide a contact to new data, a request to set-up a new TEITOK corpus for a new language, a link to a repository with a full-data that should be mirrored on UDMorph,etc.
