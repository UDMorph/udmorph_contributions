# UDMorph Contibutions

This is a dedicated project where people can contribute to [UDMorph](https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/services/teitok-live/udmorph/), an infrastructure to provide POS taggers and training data.

To contribute, create an issue with any contribution information. This can any of the contribution types listed below, but it can also be a bug report or feature request for the UDMorph site as a whole.

## Contribution types

Contributions can be of various type, including but not limited to:

- Existing UD-conformant annotated data-sets that can be hosted as a repository here (and used to train taggers)
- Requests for a new corpus in the TEITOK environment, where you can create a gold-standard annotated corpus in a guided fashion
- An existing data-set that can be converted to UD, and maintained either as a repository or in the TEITOK GUI
- A link to a REST service for a tagger, ideally with an output in CoNLL-U
- A model for a tagger/lemmatizer for UDPIPE, Stanza, Spacy, or any other major NLP pipeline; ideally following UD annotations
- The source code for a tagger that can be installed locally, ideally with an output in CoNLL-U
